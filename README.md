# VxKex
VxKex is a set of API extensions for Windows 7 that allow some Windows 8, 8.1 and 10-exclusive applications to run on Windows 7.
<br>
To download and install, see the <a href="https://github.com/vxiiduu1/VxKex/releases">releases page</a>.
After installation, usage is easy: just right click on a program (.exe or .msi), open the Properties dialog, and select the VxKex tab. Then, check the check box which says "Enable VxKex for this program".
